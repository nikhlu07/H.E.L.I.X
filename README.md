## ⚠️ The Problem: Jhalawar School Collapse

**December 2022, Rajasthan** - Seven children died when a school building collapsed during a mid-day meal program. Investigation revealed a systematic corruption chain:

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Total Budget** | ₹6 crore allocated |
| **Diverted Funds** | ₹4.28 crore (71%) |
| **Consequence** | Substandard materials → Structural failure |
| **Lives Lost** | 7 children killed, 12 injured |

## 💡 Final Note

*"Technology alone cannot eliminate corruption, but it can make corruption so difficult, transparent, and risky that honest governance becomes the rational choice."*

H.E.L.I.X. is more than code—it's a commitment to a future where public resources reach their intended destinations. Every feature we build, every fraud pattern we detect, and every transparency tool we deploy honors the memory of those lost to systemic corruption.

### Why H.E.L.I.X. Matters

- **For Citizens**: Transparency and accountability in how public funds are used
- **For Governments**: Tools to prevent corruption and build public trust
- **For Vendors**: Fair, transparent procurement processes
- **For NGOs**: Powerful oversight tools for independent monitoring
- **For Developers**: Open-source platform to build upon and improve
- **For the World**: A blueprint for corruption-resistant governance systems

**Join us in building a more transparent, accountable world. One transaction at a time.** ⚡
