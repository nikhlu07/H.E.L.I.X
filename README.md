## 🌟 Overview

H.E.L.I.X. is a Web3-powered transparency platform designed to eliminate corruption in public procurement and fund distribution. Built on the Internet Computer blockchain, it combines AI-driven fraud detection with immutable record-keeping to create an ecosystem where transparency is enforced by design.

Born from the tragedy of the Jhalawar school collapse—where ₹4.28 crore of diverted funds led to seven deaths—H.E.L.I.X. represents a technological solution to a systemic problem that costs governments billions and citizens their trust.

### 🎯 Core Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered Fraud Detection**: Real-time analysis using LLM-based hybrid RAG pipeline with 90%+ accuracy
- **⛓️ Blockchain Immutability**: Tamper-proof records on Internet Computer Protocol
- **🏛️ Hierarchical Data Flow**: Government → State → Deputy → Vendor tracking system
- **👥 Multi-Role Dashboards**: Six specialized interfaces for all stakeholders
- **🛡️ Citizen Oversight**: Public access for transparency and anomaly reporting
- **📊 Predictive Analytics**: Advanced algorithms for corruption risk forecasting

## ⚠️ The Problem: Jhalawar School Collapse

**December 2022, Rajasthan** - Seven children died when a school building collapsed during a mid-day meal program. Investigation revealed a systematic corruption chain:

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Total Budget** | ₹6 crore allocated |
| **Diverted Funds** | ₹4.28 crore (71%) |
| **Consequence** | Substandard materials → Structural failure |
| **Lives Lost** | 7 children killed, 12 injured |
| **Justice Status** | Delayed by bureaucratic complexities |

**H.E.L.I.X. Mission: Prevent future tragedies through technological transparency.**

- **Public Verification**: Anyone can independently audit the ledger
- **Flexible Authentication**: Live ICP, Demo II, or simple demo mode

### 👥 Multi-Role Dashboard System

**Six Specialized Interfaces:**

1. **Government Dashboard** - National oversight, policy analytics, cross-regional insights
2. **State Head Dashboard** - Regional budget allocation and performance tracking
3. **Deputy Officer Dashboard** - District-level procurement and vendor management
4. **Vendor Portal** - Bid submission, contract tracking, payment status
5. **Sub-Supplier Interface** - Delivery coordination and quality verification
6. **Citizen Portal** - Public transparency, anonymous reporting, impact tracking

### 🏛️ Hierarchical Data Flow

Complete end-to-end tracking:
```
Main Government → State Head → Deputy Officer → Vendor → Sub-Supplier → Citizen Verification
```

Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain with:
- Timestamp and principal ID
- Budget allocation amounts
- Approval workflows
- Fraud detection results
- Public audit accessibility

## 💡 Final Note

*"Technology alone cannot eliminate corruption, but it can make corruption so difficult, transparent, and risky that honest governance becomes the rational choice."*

H.E.L.I.X. is more than code—it's a commitment to a future where public resources reach their intended destinations. Every feature we build, every fraud pattern we detect, and every transparency tool we deploy honors the memory of those lost to systemic corruption.

**Join us in building a more transparent, accountable world. One transaction at a time.** ⚡
