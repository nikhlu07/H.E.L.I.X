I've created a **much simpler and working** Internet Identity authentication system that:

✅ **Just Works** - No complex backend setup required
✅ **One-Click Login** - Simple button click authentication
✅ **Auto Role Assignment** - Assigns roles based on your Internet Identity
✅ **TypeScript Safe** - Full type safety and error handling
