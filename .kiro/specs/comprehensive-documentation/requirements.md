# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive technical documentation for the H.E.L.I.X. (Humanitarian Economic Logistics & Integrity Xchange) project. The documentation will serve as a complete reference for developers, contributors, and stakeholders to understand the system architecture, components, and implementation details.

## Requirements

4. IF a developer is new to the project THEN they SHALL be able to set up and run the system using the documentation

### Requirement 2: Frontend Architecture Documentation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want detailed documentation of the React/TypeScript frontend, so that I can understand the component structure, authentication flow, and dashboard implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frontend developer reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL understand the component hierarchy and organization
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN developers SHALL have clear examples of authentication patterns
3. WHEN working with dashboards THEN developers SHALL understand the role-based access control implementation
4. IF a developer needs to add new UI components THEN they SHALL find guidelines for the design system and component patterns

### Requirement 3: Backend API Documentation

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can understand the FastAPI implementation, endpoints, and integration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backend developer reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL understand all API endpoints and their purposes
2. WHEN implementing new endpoints THEN developers SHALL have clear patterns for authentication and authorization
3. WHEN integrating with external services THEN developers SHALL understand the service architecture
4. IF a developer needs to modify fraud detection THEN they SHALL understand the detection engine architecture

### Requirement 4: Blockchain/ICP Integration Documentation

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want detailed documentation of the Internet Computer integration, so that I can understand the canister architecture and smart contract implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blockchain developer reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL understand the canister structure and deployment
2. WHEN working with smart contracts THEN developers SHALL understand the Motoko implementations
3. WHEN integrating Internet Identity THEN developers SHALL have clear authentication flow documentation
4. IF a developer needs to deploy to mainnet THEN they SHALL find complete deployment procedures

### Requirement 5: AI/ML Fraud Detection Documentation

**User Story:** As a data scientist or ML engineer, I want comprehensive documentation of the fraud detection engines, so that I can understand the detection algorithms, rules, and model implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ML engineer reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL understand all fraud detection rules and algorithms
2. WHEN improving detection accuracy THEN engineers SHALL understand the hybrid RAG architecture
3. WHEN working with the autonomous engine THEN engineers SHALL understand the self-healing and learning components
4. IF an engineer needs to add new detection rules THEN they SHALL find clear patterns and examples

### Requirement 6: Deployment and Operations Documentation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want detailed deployment and operations documentation, so that I can deploy, monitor, and maintain the system in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DevOps engineer reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL understand all deployment options
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN engineers SHALL have step-by-step deployment procedures
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN engineers SHALL understand health checks and metrics
4. IF issues arise THEN engineers SHALL have troubleshooting guides and common solutions

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow Documentation

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want clear development workflow documentation, so that I can set up my development environment and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new contributor joins THEN they SHALL be able to set up their development environment
2. WHEN making changes THEN contributors SHALL understand the testing requirements
3. WHEN submitting code THEN contributors SHALL understand the code quality standards
4. IF a contributor wants to add features THEN they SHALL understand the contribution process

### Requirement 8: Security and Compliance Documentation

**User Story:** As a security auditor or compliance officer, I want comprehensive security documentation, so that I can understand the security measures and compliance features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security auditor reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL understand all security measures
2. WHEN assessing compliance THEN auditors SHALL find documentation of data protection measures
3. WHEN reviewing authentication THEN auditors SHALL understand the principal-based security model
4. IF vulnerabilities are found THEN auditors SHALL understand the security reporting process
