## 🎯 Blockchain-Powered Justice

These smart contracts represent the **immutable foundation** of H.E.L.I.X. Every transaction, every decision, every fraud detection result is permanently recorded on the Internet Computer blockchain, ensuring that corruption evidence can never be deleted, modified, or hidden.

**In Jhalawar, corruption files disappeared in bureaucracy. On ICP, corruption evidence is eternal.**

## 🔐 Advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Principal ID Authorization System

Every user is authenticated via Internet Identity and assigned a unique Principal ID. The smart contracts enforce strict role-based permissions with granular control:

```motoko
// Comprehensive user role system with detailed permissions
type UserRole = {
  #MainGovernment : { departments: [Text]; regions: [Text] };
  #StateHead : { state: Text; districts: [Text] };
  #Deputy : { district: Text; projects: [Text] };
  #Vendor : { category: Text; max_contract_value: Nat };
  #SubSupplier : { vendor: Principal; services: [Text] };
  #Citizen : { verified: Bool; region: ?Text };
  #Auditor : { scope: AuditScope; certification: Text };
  #Investigator : { cases: [Text]; clearance_level: Nat };
};

// Permission matrix enforced on-chain with context awareness
func hasPermission(
  principal: Principal, 
  action: Action, 
  resource: Resource, 
  context: ActionContext
) : Bool {
  switch (getUserRole(principal)) {
    case (#MainGovernment(details)) { 
      checkGovernmentPermissions(details, action, resource, context)
    };
    case (#StateHead(details)) { 
      checkStatePermissions(details, action, resource, context)
    };
    case (#Deputy(details)) { 
      checkDistrictPermissions(details, action, resource, context)
    };
    // ... additional role checks with context validation
  }
}
```

### Multi-Signature Security

High-value transactions require multiple approvals with blockchain verification:

```motoko
// Multi-signature workflow for critical operations
public shared(msg) func proposeHighValueTransaction(
  operation: Operation,
  value: Nat
) : async Result<TransactionId, Error> {
  if (value > MAX_SINGLE_APPROVAL) {
    let required_sigs = calculateRequiredSignatures(value);
    // Create multi-sig transaction with blockchain proof
    await createMultiSigTransaction(operation, value, required_sigs);
  }
}
```
