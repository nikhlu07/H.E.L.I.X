### Component Interactions

1. **Decision Engine** receives fraud assessment and determines autonomous action
2. **Ethics Guard** validates decision meets fairness and explainability criteria
3. **Investigator** gathers additional evidence for high-risk cases
4. **Evidence Manager** preserves all evidence immutably on blockchain
5. **Communication Manager** notifies relevant stakeholders
6. **Audit Manager** logs all decisions for transparency
7. **Learning Engine** updates patterns based on investigation outcomes
8. **Self-Healing** monitors system health and auto-remediates issues

## Key Concepts

### Autonomous Decision Matrix

The decision engine uses risk thresholds to determine actions:

```python
decision_matrix = {
    "immediate_block": 0.90,        # Block transaction immediately
    "escalate_investigation": 0.80,  # Launch autonomous investigation
    "request_verification": 0.65,    # Request additional verification
    "enhanced_monitoring": 0.45,     # Enable enhanced monitoring
    "standard_processing": 0.30      # Proceed normally
}
```

### Self-Healing Architecture

The system continuously monitors its own health:

```python
health_monitors = {
    "model_performance": ModelHealthMonitor(),
    "data_quality": DataQualityMonitor(),
    "system_latency": LatencyMonitor(),
    "fraud_detection_accuracy": AccuracyMonitor()
}
```

When issues are detected, automatic remediation occurs:
- **Model Performance Issues** → Retrain model autonomously
- **Data Quality Problems** → Clean and validate data
- **Latency Spikes** → Scale resources automatically
- **Accuracy Degradation** → Recalibrate detection thresholds

### Continuous Learning Loop

The learning engine improves detection over time:

1. **Prediction Made**: Initial fraud score assigned
2. **Investigation Outcome**: Actual fraud status determined
3. **Error Calculation**: Compare prediction vs. reality
4. **Pattern Update**: Strengthen or adjust detection patterns
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy updated model when threshold reached

```python
# False negative (missed fraud) → Strengthen detection
if actual_fraud and predicted_score < 0.7:
    await strengthen_detection_pattern(features)

# False positive (false alarm) → Adjust sensitivity
elif not actual_fraud and predicted_score > 0.8:
    await adjust_sensitivity(features)
```

### Ethics Guardrails

All autonomous decisions are validated for:
- **Fairness**: No bias against specific vendors or regions
- **Explainability**: Clear reasoning for every decision
- **Proportionality**: Response matches severity of risk
- **Reversibility**: Human override capability maintained
- **Transparency**: All decisions logged immutably

## Usage Examples

### Autonomous Decision Execution

```python
from app.autonomous_fraud_engine.core.decision_engine import AutonomousDecisionEngine

# Initialize decision engine
decision_engine = AutonomousDecisionEngine()

# Execute autonomous decision based on fraud assessment
fraud_assessment = {
    "transaction_id": "tx_12345",
    "risk_score": 0.92,
    "reasoning": "Multiple fraud indicators detected",
    "evidence": {...}
}

await decision_engine.execute_autonomous_decision(fraud_assessment)

# Actions taken automatically:
# 1. Transaction blocked immediately
# 2. Evidence preserved on blockchain
# 3. Law enforcement notified
# 4. Audit log created
```

### Self-Healing Activation

```python
from app.autonomous_fraud_engine.core.self_healing import SelfHealingFraudPipeline

# Initialize self-healing pipeline
healing_pipeline = SelfHealingFraudPipeline()

# Run autonomous health check
health_results = await healing_pipeline.autonomous_health_check()

# System automatically:
# - Detects degraded components
# - Executes remediation actions
# - Logs healing events
# - Triggers emergency failover if critical
```

### Continuous Learning

```python
from app.autonomous_fraud_engine.core.learning import AutonomousLearningEngine

# Initialize learning engine
learning_engine = AutonomousLearningEngine()

# Learn from investigation outcome
case_data = {
    "case_id": "case_789",
    "initial_fraud_score": 0.65,
    "investigation_result": "confirmed_fraud",
    "features": {
        "amount_variance": 0.8,
        "vendor_history": 0.3,
        "timing_anomaly": 0.9
    }
}

await learning_engine.autonomous_pattern_learning(case_data)

# System automatically:
# - Calculates prediction error
# - Updates detection patterns
# - Deploys improved model when ready
```

### Autonomous Investigation

```python
from app.autonomous_fraud_engine.core.investigator import AutonomousInvestigator

# Initialize investigator
investigator = AutonomousInvestigator()

# Launch autonomous investigation
fraud_case = FraudCase(
    case_id="case_456",
    vendor="vendor_123",
    amount=500000,
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    risk_score=0.85,
    evidence={}
)

investigation_result = await investigator.conduct_autonomous_investigation(fraud_case)

# Investigator automatically:
# - Analyzes documents semantically
# - Maps vendor networks
# - Traces money flows
# - Gathers additional evidence
# - Generates investigation report
```
